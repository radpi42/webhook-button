# Goal
The goal is to create a button that when pushed calls a configured http(s) url.
The idea of hardware setup was developed by my colleague - Aleksander Iwa≈Ñski. 

# How will it work?

The webhook button is powered up by a battery. When the webhook button is powered up WiFi is enabled. 
The button exposes following services:
- /wifi
   
   a html service that allows configuration of wifi connection to an access point.
- [GET] /webhook

    return current configuration of http(s) url address that is called when the button is pushed
    
- [POST] /webhook

    {
        url: `url address to be called`
        headers: [] `array of headers that are passed along the request`
        method: `valid http method like GET, POST, PUT, ...`
        payload: `a string that represents payload`
    } 

When the webhook button is pushed then it calls the configured url accordingly to the configuration

# Setup

For hardware we decided on:
* Arduino NodeMCU v3 (used to ease development of targeted ESP8266)
* ESP8266

Hardware without software is like an empty shell. To push some life into it, I've decided to use as base:
* [platformio](https://platformio.org) and
* [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

## Preparation of the environment

1. Install platformio
   
    `brew install platformio` or `pip install -U platformio`
    
    In case of platformio was installed in version 4.0.x please upgrade to 4.1.x because of an issue that
    is corrected in 4.1.x
    Currently 4.1.x is under development, so an upgrade to development version is required: `platformio upgrade --dev`
    
1. Clone this project
    
    `git clone https://github.com/venth/webhook-button.git` 

1. Go to freshly created directory "webhook-button" and prepare project's for CLion

    Create project's directory and within the directory execute command:
    `platformio init --ide clion --board nodemcuv2` 

1. Compile project

    `platformio run`
    
1. Connect arduino to computer with USB port
1. Upload program

    `platformio run --target upload`
1. [Optional] reset arduino (stop blinking)
    
    Set `constant WORKING_PROGRAM   = false;`
    compile by `platformio run` and upload `platformio run --target upload`

# Daily things

* adding library
    * add entry in platformio.ini file to `lib_deps` property
    * update CLion project settings by executing command: `platformio init --ide clion --board nodemcuv2`
    
# Fighting diary

The first issue encountered during development was:
* failing tests - yeah, I wrote some, because wanted to check, whether the code works on the device

    ```
    Please wait...

    #include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
    ```
    
    There are two issue in the aforementioned comment. First - `platformio' cannot create archive and 
    second - on the native platform we try to compile embedded library.
    
    To fix the first issue the code that contains references to embedded library is excluded in the native section of the platformio.ini file:
    `src_filter = +<*> -<main.cpp>` 
    
    The second issue is also corrected by change in the configuration. Adding `lib_archive = false` made platformio to omit
    archive creation.
    
The second one were related to template library I chose to ease my life and introduce pub/sub:
* [Embedded Template Library](https://www.etlcpp.com) compilation issues
    
    In the first approach `lib_deps =` section contained just the name of library, which caused installation of the most
    recently compiled library for the os. Unfortunately OSX compilation is quite old. To fix the issue installation
    by library name is replaced by installation by github repository url along with version (`https://github.com/ETLCPP/etl.git#14.26.7`).
    
    The next issue is caused by ecl_timer.c file. The fix is to use script executed before build that removes ecl_timer
    files. The script name: `clean_timer.py` and configuration in the platformio.ini: `extra_scripts = pre:clean_timer.py`
    
    Ambiguous stl functions issue was caused by wrongly prepared `etl_profile.h` file. Currently instead of using direct include of
    a specific profile just add `#define PROFILE_XXX`

The appeared that some libraries are not best choice for embedded development:
* `pio test -e nodemcuv2` ended up with unknown error

    The error: 
    ```

    ```
    
    To nail down the issue a test that only passes was used along with commented out code.
    By enabling small part of the code appeared that first couse was usage of: `#include <iostream>` 
    Removal of usage of the `iostream` made the test to pass.
    
    Searching continues.
    
    Now the issue looks like that:
    
    ```

    Nailing down the issue lead to `std::ostringstream` and `#include <sstream>`. The solution is
    to replace `sstream` with `combination of std::string and sprintf`.

Then when I came back to this project it appeared that platformio upgraded itselves to 4.0.x version and:
* `TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable` after I issued the command: `pio init --ide clion --board nodemcuv2`

    Solution of this issue was simply upgrade to dev version by command: `pio upgrade --dev` and now
    initialization just works.
